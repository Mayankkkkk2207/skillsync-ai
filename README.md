## 📅 Development Progress

## ✅ Day 1 – Project Initialization & Backend Setup
- Initialized Node.js backend
- Installed core dependencies (express, mongoose, dotenv)
- Connected MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Created basic folder structure
- Verified server startup

---

## ✅ Day 2 – Database Models & Structure
- Created User model using Mongoose
- Designed schema with validations
- Tested MongoDB connection stability
- Prepared base for authentication system

---

## ✅ Day 3 – Authentication (Register & Login)
- Implemented user registration
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Implemented login functionality
- JWT token generation on login
- Validated credentials with proper HTTP status codes

---

## ✅ Day 4 – Authorization & Middleware
- Created JWT authentication middleware
- Protected private routes
- Implemented user-specific access control
- Added authorization headers handling

---

## ✅ Day 5 – API Structuring & Job Routes
- API versioning using `/api/v1`
- Created Job routes and controllers
- Protected job-related endpoints
- Tested all routes using Postman
- Clean error handling and responses

---

## ✅ Day 6 – Frontend Setup
- Initialized React app using Vite
- Installed and configured Tailwind CSS v4
- Installed React Router DOM
- Setup Axios instance
- Resolved Tailwind v4 + Vite integration issues
- Fixed dependency and config conflicts

---

## ✅ Day 7 – Full Auth Flow & Dashboard Integration
- Implemented frontend authentication flow
- Login & Register pages connected to backend
- JWT token stored securely in localStorage
- Axios interceptor to attach token automatically
- Protected dashboard route using custom ProtectedRoute
- Connected dashboard to secured backend endpoint
- Debugged and resolved:
  - 404 route issues
  - API version mismatch
  - 401 invalid credentials
  - MongoDB data consistency
- Verified complete login → dashboard flow

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow
1. User registers with hashed password
2. User logs in and receives JWT token
3. Token stored in browser
4. Axios interceptor attaches token to requests
5. Protected routes validate token before access

## ✅ Day 8 – Job Management & Dashboard UI

Day 8 focused on turning the application into a usable product by implementing job creation and job listing features with a real dashboard interface.

### Backend Enhancements
- Implemented job creation endpoint (`POST /api/v1/jobs`)
- Implemented job listing endpoint (`GET /api/v1/jobs`)
- Added job status support (`applied`, `interview`, `offer`, `rejected`)
- Implemented pagination and filtering support in job listing
- Added job statistics endpoint (`GET /api/v1/jobs/stats`)
- Ensured all job routes are protected using JWT middleware

### Frontend Enhancements
- Created **Add Job** page with form validation
- Connected job creation form to secured backend API
- Updated Dashboard to display user-specific job listings
- Implemented job list UI with role, company, and status
- Added navigation from dashboard to add-job page
- Handled paginated API response structure correctly

### Key Technical Learnings
- Handling paginated API responses on the frontend
- Aligning frontend state with backend response structure
- Debugging data shape mismatches (`jobs.map is not a function`)
- Building scalable CRUD-ready architecture

### Result
By the end of Day 8, users can securely:
- Add job applications
- View all their jobs on a dashboard
- See real-time data fetched from protected APIs

This marks the transition from a basic authenticated system to a functional job-tracking product.
